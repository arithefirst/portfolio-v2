Hi, I'm April, but most people call me Ari. I'm a fullstack software developer with a focus on frontend, based in New Jersey, USA. My journey in programming began when I received a Raspberry Pi for my 9th birthday, and I've been passionate about coding ever since.

I specialize in creating engaging user experiences using modern frameworks and tools, and I continually challenge myself by working on personal projects and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to make sure my skills never fall flat.

Outside of tech, I'm a jazz saxophonist, specifically bari sax. Playing jazz has been a creative outlet for me for years, and I love performing and playing in ensembles whenever I get the chance. I'm also learning tuba to march DCI with the <a href="https://bushwackersdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bushwackers Drum and Bugle Corps</a> next summer!

## In My Free Time, I Enjoy:

- Working on personal programming projects
- System Administration/Homelabbing
- Watching my favorite content creators
- Studying <abbr title="German">Deutsch</abbr> in hopes to one day become fluent
- Occasionally playing video games like
  **Pokemon**, <br>
  **Phasmophobia**, **Animal Crossing**, and others
