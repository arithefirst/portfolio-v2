Hi, I'm April, but most people call me Ari. I'm a fullstack software developer with a focus on frontend, based in New Jersey, USA. My journey in programming began when I received a Raspberry Pi for my 9th birthday, and I've been passionate about coding ever since.

I specialize in creating engaging user experiences using modern frameworks and tools, and I continually challenge myself by working on personal projects and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to make sure my skills never fall flat.

## In My Free Time, I Enjoy:

- Working on personal programming projects
- System Administration/Homelabbing
- Watching my favorite content creators
- Studying <abbr title="German">Deutsch</abbr> in hopes to one day become fluent
- Occasionally playing video games like
  [Overwatch 2](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/),
  [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/)
  [ULTRAKILL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/),
  and others
