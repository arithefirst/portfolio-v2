Hi, I'm April, but most people call me Ari. I'm a fullstack software developer with a focus on frontend, based in New Jersey, USA. My journey in programming began when I received a Raspberry Pi for my 9th birthday, and I've been passionate about coding ever since.

I specialize in creating engaging user experiences using modern frameworks and tools, and I continually challenge myself by working on personal projects and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies.

## In My Free Time, I Enjoy:

- Working on personal programming projects
- System Administration/Homelabbing
- Watching my favorite twitch streamers
- Occasionally playing video games like [ULTRAKILL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/), [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/), and others.
